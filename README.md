# ‚òï Java SE Assignments 

This repository contains a collection of structured Java SE programming assignments developed for academic coursework and personal practice.

Each assignment targets fundamental programming concepts in Java, ranging from control structures and loops to object-oriented programming and business logic modeling.

## üìÅ Structure

Each folder named `assignmentXX` includes:

- Java source code in a `src/` directory
- A `run.bat` (Windows) and/or `run.sh` (Linux/macOS) script to compile and execute the program
- A `README.md` with the original problem description
- Logic diagrams (in `assignment05`, if applicable)
